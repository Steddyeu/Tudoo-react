# Tudoo-react

'Todo lists, the 'hello world' of react'



In this project I made a basic todo list with some basic functionality. 

The list has an add button aswell as a delete button. 

You can also edit items inline, instead of having to delete and rewrite. 


A basic react project. 

a tudo list. 
the hello world of react, with some added functionality and styling. 
you can edit inline with each task. 

I also used react-flip-move for adding and deleting tasks. 

install:  ```npm i react-flip-move```


 #Further improvements planned. 

 I intend to mimic the eisenhower method, with four todo cards, which will rank the importance of a task.

 Below the four tables here will be a daily calender, broken up into 2 hour sprints so you can square tasks away.
